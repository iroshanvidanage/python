# challenge from the magic methods

from random import randint

'''
    Requirements:

    Implement the missing magic methods from the Deity and Pantheon classes.

        Deity:

            Implement the __int__ method to return the health value.
            Implement the __bool method to retun True if the health value is greater than zero.
        
        Pantheon:

            Implement the __bool__ method to return True if any available deities exist according to the available attribute.
